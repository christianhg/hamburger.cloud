    <h1>Hi, I'm Christian</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a functional programming enthusiast, highly interested in the craft of
      programming and creating simpler programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a front-end developer at{' '}
      <a href="http://escenic.com">Escenic AS</a> where I fight complexity in
      large applications for newsrooms. I've been developing for the Web on and
      off since the early 2000s, I got a good eye for design and UX and used to
      pursue a more design-oriented career.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I don't find myself occupied by doing, reading or thinking about
      programming, I'm enjoying my time together with my family in the wonderful
      city of Oslo, Norway.
