title: 'The Principles of id'
lead: "One of the best talks about programming isn't even about programming."

During the span of less than six years (1991-1996) and with fewer than 10 developers, id software created 28 games.

The early days of programming fascinates me, and lately I've directed my interest at id Software.

> 1. No prototypes. Just make the game. Polish as you go.
>    Don't depend on polish happening later.
>    Always maintain constantly shippable code.
>    (Large teams require more planning though.)

> 2. It's incredibly important that your game can always be run
>    by your team. Bulletproof your engine by providing defaults
>    (for input data) upon load failure.

> 3. Keep your code absolutely simple. Keep looking at your
>    functions and figure out how you can simplify further.

> 4. Great tools help make great games. Spend as much time on
>    tools as possible.

> 5. We are our own best testing team and should never allow
>    anyone else to experience bugs or see the game crash.
>    Don't waste others' time. Test thoroughly before checking
>    in your code.

> 6. As soon as you see a bug, you fix it. Do not continue on.
>    If you don't fix your bugs your new code will be built
>    on a buggy codebase and ensure an unstable foundation.

> 7. Use a development system that is superior to your target.

> 8. Write your code for this game only - not for a future game.
>    You're going to be writing new code later because you'll be smarter.

> 9. Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency.
>    This minimizes mistakes and saves design time.

> 10. Try to code transparently. Tell your lead and peers exactly
>     how you are going to solve your current task and get feedback
>     and advice. Do not treat game programming like each coder is a
>     black box. The project could go off the rails and cause delays.

> 11. Programming is a creative art form based in logic. Every programmer
>     is different and will code differently. It's the output that matters.
